# AI Coding Agent Instructions for `pythoncrashcourse`

Welcome to the `pythoncrashcourse` repository! This document provides essential guidelines for AI coding agents to be productive and aligned with the project's structure and goals.

## Project Overview
`pythoncrashcourse` is a collection of Python scripts organized into thematic directories. The project is designed for learning and experimenting with Python concepts, ranging from variables and numbers to lists and conditional statements.

### Directory Structure
- **`1. Variables/`**: Scripts demonstrating variable usage, string manipulation, and basic operations.
- **`2. Numbers/`**: Examples of working with numbers in Python.
- **`3. Lists/`**: Scripts showcasing list operations and manipulations.
- **`4. Working with lists/`**: Advanced list operations, including slicing and iteration.
- **`5. If Statements/`**: Examples of conditional logic and branching.

## Key Conventions
- **File Naming**: Files are named descriptively to reflect their content (e.g., `hello_world.py`, `banned_users.py`).
- **Code Style**: Follow PEP 8 guidelines for Python code. Use meaningful variable names and include comments where necessary.
- **Learning Focus**: The code is intentionally simple and self-contained to facilitate learning.

## Developer Workflows
- **Testing**: There is no formal test suite. To test a script, run it directly using Python:
  ```bash
  python <script_name>.py
  ```
- **Debugging**: Use print statements or Python's built-in debugger (`pdb`) for debugging.

## Contribution Guidelines
- **New Scripts**: Place new scripts in the appropriate directory based on their theme. Ensure the script name is descriptive.
- **Documentation**: Add comments to explain the purpose of the script and any non-obvious code.

## Examples of Patterns
- **Variable Manipulation**: See `1. Variables/name_cases.py` for examples of string case transformations.
- **List Operations**: Refer to `3. Lists/bicycles.py` for basic list operations and `4. Working with lists/players.py` for slicing and iteration.
- **Conditional Logic**: Check `5. If Statements/cars.py` for examples of `if-elif-else` statements.

## External Dependencies
This project does not rely on any external libraries or dependencies. All scripts use Python's standard library.
